## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Market-first information hierarchy
The dashboard SHALL prioritize a market overview with current values and percentage changes for the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and ChiNext indexes. It SHALL then show market breadth and price-change distribution, an emotion radar, trend strength, a limit-up ladder, concept heat, market pulse, AI market summary, watchlist quotes, and selected-stock detail. The added market cards SHALL use traceable browser market data and expose the last successful data time, source, and availability state. Upward and downward market colors SHALL follow the A-share red-up/green-down convention.

#### Scenario: Market data loads successfully
- **WHEN** index, market-snapshot, board, limit-pool, or watchlist data loads successfully
- **THEN** its area shows normalized data with last-market time and source status, while upward and downward values follow the A-share red-up/green-down convention

#### Scenario: Market snapshot loads successfully
- **WHEN** full-market quotes, concept boards, and limit pools are available
- **THEN** the dashboard shows breadth and distribution, an emotion radar with overall score and dimension values, trend strength based on price strength and 52-week high/low positions, a limit-up ladder grouped by consecutive-board count, and concept heat ordered by percentage change

#### Scenario: A single area fails
- **WHEN** any one of indexes, market snapshot, market pulse, watchlist, or stock detail fails to load
- **THEN** the system shows an error or stale state only in that area and continues showing all other successful areas

### Requirement: Dashboard polling and visibility control
The dashboard SHALL refresh market data every 15 seconds while its page is visible, pause polling while hidden, and refresh immediately when it becomes visible again. The high-cost full-market snapshot SHALL be browser-cached for at most 60 seconds, and ordinary dashboard polling SHALL reuse that snapshot without a repeat public-upstream request while it is valid. A cached AI summary SHALL not trigger a new model call during market polling.

#### Scenario: Poll while visible
- **WHEN** a user remains on a visible `/dashboard` page for more than 15 seconds
- **THEN** the system refreshes dashboard market data and reuses the last successful full-market snapshot while its cache is valid

#### Scenario: Pause while hidden
- **WHEN** `document.visibilityState` becomes `hidden`
- **THEN** the system stops subsequent market polling until the page becomes visible again

#### Scenario: Return to the dashboard tab
- **WHEN** the page returns from hidden to visible
- **THEN** the system refreshes market data immediately without waiting for the next polling interval
